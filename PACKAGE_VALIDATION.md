# Package extraction validation

## Shared Overpass recovery: 6.4.1 (145)

Validated September 6, 2026 on macOS with signed Debug and Release builds.

- Network passes 18 tests in Debug and Release, including shared queue priority,
  cancellation while queued and active, outage fallback, endpoint cooldown,
  HTTP 429 Retry-After handling without host rotation, runtime errors, invalid
  queries, and unrelated HTTP requests bypassing the queue.
- Services passes 2 tests with 75 parameterized request cases in both configurations.
  Location 6, Process 16, and Tools 22 also pass; Process and Tools pass Release.
- The isolated app target passes 8 tests, including both unavailable and empty
  waterway responses falling back to the nearest official gauge.
- Signed Debug and Release builds and deep/strict signature verification pass.
  Dependency pins and signing configuration remain unchanged.
- Live Debug startup confirms water-level recovery (4.02 m) despite Overpass
  failure. COVID district and POI queries still time out against the secondary
  endpoint during this check; their live recovery is not validated. The primary
  endpoint is unreachable, while the secondary status page responds but even a
  fixed public OSM object query times out. Do not equate status-page success or
  injected test success with successful live data loading.
- Preferences were not changed during this recovery check. The Debug app remains
  running. No commit was created.

## Points of interest: 6.4.0 (144)

Validated September 5, 2026 with Apple Swift 6.2.4 and Xcode 26.3 on macOS.

- The unhosted `PointOfInterestTests` target passes all 7 Swift Testing tests.
  It compiles the isolated app POI sources without launching the app and injects
  fetching, location, clock/ticks, and a temporary preferences domain. Coverage
  includes stable OSM IDs, unnamed nodes and ways, duplicates, malformed data,
  viewport culling and invalid projection, preservation of 10,000 coincident
  points, geometry invalidation, cache expiry, movement, settings persistence,
  fallback startup, timer refresh, cooldown, cancellation, stale results, the
  two-request limit across generations, partial publication while one category
  remains blocked, and shutdown.
- Package suites pass: Location 6 and Network 12 in Debug; Process 16, Tools 22,
  and Services 2 in both Debug and Release. Services includes 75 parameterized
  request cases. Tests do not contact live APIs.
- Final signed Debug and Release app builds pass, as do deep/strict signature
  checks. The only build warning is the existing optional App Intents metadata
  extraction notice. Dependency pins, signing identity, and entitlements are
  unchanged.
- Optimized temporary harnesses use the real map, overlay, and deterministic
  2,000/10,000-point fixtures. Projection takes about 2.1–2.3 ms and 10.5–11.2 ms
  respectively on this Mac. Both retain exactly six native annotations, settle
  to 0% reported process CPU, and stop projecting after initial map setup.
  These are local measurements, not guaranteed hardware-independent limits.
- Stress testing reproduced an IOGPU/RenderBox encoder crash with 10,000 repeated
  SwiftUI symbol draws, and again with resolved SwiftUI images. The final Canvas
  uses one Core Graphics image pass; both dense fixtures render successfully.
  POIs stay at their coordinates beneath the environmental labels and native
  markers. Apple places remain visible. Dense symbols intentionally overlap.
- Live Debug startup fetched all five categories successfully. The master switch
  and all five individual switches changed state correctly and were restored.
  Successful cached results survived those switches without additional POI
  requests. Clean app shutdown passed; exercised preferences were restored to
  their exact original values, including absent keys.
- The final live accessibility tree exposes one POI count summary through an
  explicit text accessibility representation. A label on Canvas alone did not
  expose that summary on this macOS version. Environmental labels remain separate
  accessible text and decorative POI symbols do not create duplicate entries.
- Later live Overpass requests intermittently failed or returned no data. The
  final presenter publishes successful categories immediately and retries failed
  categories after the five-minute cooldown; the blocked-category regression
  test verifies that other results are not held back. Popover reopening preserves
  the summary. The final Debug app remains running; live counts can remain zero
  while the external service is unavailable. Original POI preferences remain
  restored exactly.
- Formatting and whitespace checks pass. No iOS integration, notarization, or
  publication was performed. No commit made.


## Map collision score precision: 6.3.6 (143)

Validated September 5, 2026 with Apple Swift 6.2.4 and Xcode 26.3.

- Reproduced failures before the fix: unobstructed fractional-coordinate labels
  moved away from their dots, including an unnecessary connector; obsolete offsets
  also survived after surrounding labels were removed.
- Tools Debug and Release: all 22 tests passed after the fix. Genuine clipping,
  crowded layouts, bounded fallback, and fractional placement stability still pass.
- Clipping now sums nonnegative outside strips. Contained rectangles score exactly
  zero; overlap edge noise at or below 0.0000001 point is ignored before scoring.
  The strict arrangement comparator is unchanged.
- Signed Debug and Release builds and deep/strict signature verification passed.
- Formatting and whitespace checks passed. The corrected Debug app was launched.
  The live map displayed all six enabled labels attached to their dots, including
  COVID, with no connector lines needed in that layout. The app remains running.
  No preferences, signing settings, entitlements, or dependency pins changed.
- Other package suites and app lifecycle tests were not repeated for this pure
  solver correction. Earlier validation remains recorded below. No commit made.


## Direct map label attachment: 6.3.5 (142)

Validated September 5, 2026 with Apple Swift 6.2.4 and Xcode 26.3.

- Tools Debug and Release: 19 tests passed in each configuration.
- Signed Debug and Release builds and deep/strict signature verification: passed.
- Regression cases assert exact above-right attachment and removal of obsolete
  connectors after other labels disappear or projected locations spread apart.
- The separated-location preview was rendered using the real app views in a
  temporary harness: all six labels met their dots without connector lines.
- Existing collision, marker, edge, dense-cluster, bounded-search, and fractional
  projection tests still pass. Attached labels intentionally meet their source
  marker; clearance remains enforced around unrelated markers.
- Geometry caching is unchanged. Placement scoring now prioritizes connector
  count and normal anchors ahead of retaining previous positions.
- Formatting and whitespace checks passed. No preferences were changed. Other
  package suites and the unchanged app lifecycle were not rerun for this solver
  correction; their preceding validation is recorded below. No commit was made.


## Map annotation layout: 6.3.4 (141)

Validated September 5, 2026 using Apple Swift 6.2.4 and Xcode 26.3 (17C529) on
macOS. The project spec's existing Xcode compatibility setting is unchanged.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Location Debug | 6 tests passed |
| Network Debug | 12 tests passed |
| Process Debug and Release | 16 tests passed in each configuration |
| Tools Debug and Release | 17 tests passed in each configuration |
| Services Debug and Release | 2 tests passed in each configuration |
| Signed Debug and Release app builds | Passed via build.sh, including XcodeGen regeneration |
| Debug and Release deep/strict codesign verification | Passed |
| Release bundle version | 6.3.4, build 141 |
| Swift formatting for new files and whitespace check | Passed |
| Dependency lockfile, signing configuration, entitlements | Unchanged |

Ordinary-import geometry tests cover separated and coincident points (two through
six), dense clusters, viewport edges, mixed label sizes, marker-only obstacles,
marker clearance, exact connector boundaries, grid fallback for offscreen sources,
invalid projections, undersized viewports, deterministic search bounds, and
retention after location, visibility, viewport, size, and fractional-coordinate
changes. The bounded beam is not a proof of globally optimal placement.

A temporary SwiftUI harness compiled the real app views with the deterministic
preview fixtures and inactive presenters. Six coincident labels and a narrow dense
cluster rendered with connectors. Resizing recomputed their positions; native dots
stayed at the projected sources. The undersized fixture retained all six
measurements in its accessibility tree. The accessibility tree contained each fixture
measurement once and no connector announcements. This was an accessibility-tree
inspection, not a full spoken VoiceOver audit. Harness artifacts are temporary and
are not production startup options.

Live Debug checks verified startup, Weather label off/on with the location dot
retained, COVID visibility off/on, and restoration of both exercised preferences.
The checks exposed and corrected transient MapReader registration gaps: geometry
changes now use a cancellable view task with at most eight 16 ms projection attempts,
and camera changes still update directly. Geometry and placement publish together;
text-only refreshes do not start a layout task. Projection is never performed in
body rendering. The corrected fixture emitted no AttributeGraph cycle warnings.

Popover reopening retained all five enabled labels. A normal five-minute Weather
refresh advanced the timestamp from 22:08 to 22:13 and the temperature from 14.9 °C
to 14.8 °C, with all enabled labels still present. Normal app termination completed;
no Dashboard of Doom process remained. The temporary fixture process was stopped.
Weather and COVID were restored to their original enabled values; refresh intervals
and all other preferences were untouched.

The unchanged build script's mock tests were not repeated. Builds retained the
existing AppIntents metadata extraction warning. iOS presentation is unchanged and
unvalidated. No commit was created.

## Units, tools, and services: 6.3.3 (140)

Validated September 5, 2026 using Apple Swift 6.2.4 and Xcode 26.2 on macOS.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| DoomKitLocation Debug | 6 tests passed |
| DoomKitNetwork Debug | 12 tests passed |
| DoomKitProcess Debug and Release | 16 tests passed in each |
| DoomKitTools Debug and Release | 7 test functions, 14 cases passed in each |
| DoomKitServices Debug and Release | 2 test functions, 100 cases passed in each |
| Signed Debug and Release via build.sh | Passed, including XcodeGen regeneration |
| Strict deep signature verification, both builds | Passed |
| Release bundle version | 6.3.3, build 140 |
| Local dependency graph | Acyclic; Tools depends only on Location |
| Original app Units, Utilities, Services files | All 23 removed from the app source tree |
| Dependency pin, signing settings, entitlements | Preserved |
| Whitespace check | Passed |

Ordinary-import unit tests cover all exported symbols, conversion coefficients,
base units, representative conversions, and ProcessValue use. Tools tests compare
smoothing and deterministic forecasts with outputs captured by running the original
functions before extraction. Coverage includes empty input, shortened and oversized
windows, mixed compatible units, Gaussian edge normalization and clamping,
invalid Gaussian parameters, ARIMA interval/data validation, geometry, symbol
mappings, and 100 concurrent log writes to a temporary file. Logging retains the
original lexical level filtering. No new unchecked Sendable conformance was added.

Service fixtures were captured by executing the original 25 methods against a
recording fake. All methods preserve exact requests and successful bytes, map
server errors and transport cancellation to nil, and honor cancellation before
requests. Transport, monitoring, and sleep are injected; package tests perform no
live networking or permission requests. Particle fixtures preserve the original
from-date hour for both time parameters and local calendar/formatter defaults.

The app's two Gaussian callers zip original values with smoothed measurements,
preserving order, unit, timestamp, quality, and arbitrary metadata. Construction
continues to create fresh UUIDs. Controllers, parsing, presenters, transformers,
Date extensions, and WeatherKit remain in the app.

The signed Debug popover displayed current measurements. Opening Settings and
turning Use Nearest Sensor on changed the displayed water level from 2.73 m to
4.03 m. The original off setting was restored and the measurement returned to
2.73 m. Refresh intervals were not changed. With the transient popover hidden,
the normal periodic timestamp advanced from 21:36 to 21:41; reopening it showed
the updated measurements. Debug was quit through its own Quit button.
The signed Release executable also launched, displayed measurements with a
21:41 timestamp, opened Settings, and quit through its own Quit button. Process
inspection confirmed shutdown of both builds. These checks cover startup,
measurements, popover, settings refresh, periodic refresh, and clean shutdown;
they do not establish visual correctness of every panel or permission path.

iOS remains unvalidated. Both app builds emitted only the existing skipped
AppIntents metadata extraction warning. build.sh was unchanged, so its Python
mock suite and shell checks were not repeated for this extraction. No commit
was created.

## Process module expansion: 6.3.2 (139)

Validated September 5, 2026 with Apple Swift 6.2.4 and Xcode 26.2.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| DoomKitLocation Debug | 6 tests passed |
| DoomKitNetwork Debug | 12 tests passed |
| DoomKitProcess Debug and Release | 15 tests passed in each configuration |
| Signed Debug and Release via build.sh | Passed, including XcodeGen regeneration |
| Strict signature verification, both app builds | Passed |
| App Process*.swift inventory | No files remain under DashboardOfDoom |
| Dependency pins, signing and entitlements | Preserved |

Public API tests use ordinary imports and cover external presenter subclassing,
transformer overrides, protocol conformance, model construction, UUIDs, metadata,
selector mappings, geographic helpers and default transformation output.
Coordinator tests inject source interfaces and clocks to cover inactive
construction, fallback registration, first and subsequent measured locations,
settings and periodic refreshes, timeout readiness, stop/restart, cancellation,
and weak presenter/coordinator ownership. No test uses live networking or
requests location permission.

The Debug desktop smoke test displayed current measurements and opened Settings.
The nearest-water-level-sensor setting was toggled and restored to its original
value (off); refresh intervals were left unchanged. The popover timestamp
advanced from 21:06 to 21:11 across the normal periodic interval, including
while the transient popover was hidden. Debug quit through the application
termination path. The signed Release app also launched, displayed measurements
and a 21:12 timestamp, and quit cleanly. Process inspection confirmed both
executables exited. The Release bundle reports version 6.3.2, build 139.
These checks establish startup, popover presentation, periodic data flow and
shutdown; they do not validate every visual panel or interactive permission path.

SwiftUI integration retains the observable base and app-owned concrete
presenters. Immutable presenter UUID access is explicitly nonisolated to satisfy
external Identifiable conformances under Swift 6. No unchecked Sendable
conformances or metadata conversions were introduced.

iOS remains unvalidated. The builds emit the usual skipped AppIntents metadata
extraction warning because the app does not depend on AppIntents.
Build-script checks below belong to the preceding extraction; build.sh was not
changed by this refactor.

## Earlier package extraction: 6.3.1 (138)

Validated September 5, 2026 on macOS 15.8 with Apple Swift 6.2.4 and Xcode 26.2.
App version 6.3.1, build 138. Packages declare macOS 15 and iOS 26; iOS is unvalidated.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| DoomKitLocation Debug tests | 6 tests passed, including 3 movement-threshold cases |
| DoomKitNetwork Debug tests | 12 tests passed, including 2 HTTP-status cases |
| DoomKitProcess Debug tests | 7 tests passed |
| DoomKitProcess Release tests | 7 tests passed |
| Signed Debug build after each extraction phase | Passed |
| Final signed Debug build | Passed |
| Final signed Release build | Passed, arm64 and x86_64 |
| Signature verification, Debug and Release | Passed with system trust-store access |
| Build-script Python tests | 6 passed |
| `bash -n build.sh`, `shellcheck build.sh` | Passed |
| `git diff --check` | Passed |

Package tests substitute location/geocoding providers, network transport and
monitoring, and process clocks. They do not access live network services.

The signed Debug startup smoke test received a measured location, replaced the
app-owned fallback, and fetched radiation, air-quality, water-level, and COVID
data. Quit completed through the app termination path. These logs establish
startup and data flow, not visual correctness of every panel.

The Release popover displayed current measurements and Settings opened.
Four rapid changes to the nearest-water-level-sensor toggle triggered replacement
refreshes; its original value was restored (off before and after), and the popover
remained responsive. Across the normal five-minute refresh interval, the
popover's timestamp advanced from 20:46 to 20:51 without changing refresh
preferences. Reopening the transient popover showed the new data, confirming
updates continue independently of popover visibility. The Release app then
quit cleanly.

The interactive permission-prompt paths and visual offline recovery still require
desktop smoke testing. Scheduling, authorization states, offline recovery, repeated
refresh cancellation, and late completion are covered with deterministic package
tests. No preferences were changed to shorten refresh intervals.

Build validation found two Swift 6.2.4 issues resolved in this implementation:

- constructing the default async timing closure inside the network initializer
  avoided a reproducible runtime failure in readiness tests;
- Sendable scheduler registration storage permits nonisolated teardown, avoiding
  a Release optimizer crash in a generic isolated deinitializer.

The app identity, signing settings, entitlements, and LaunchAtLogin dependency
pin were preserved. Existing untracked agent/configuration files were preserved.
No commit, remote publication, iOS integration, or native live-update provider
was performed.


## September 6, 2026: combined iOS integration

Both apps now use the local packages and Shared app source. All five package
Debug test suites pass on macOS and iOS simulator; Process, Tools, and Services
also pass in Release on both. The older iOS-unvalidated statements above describe
the historical extraction checkpoints. See [IOS_MIGRATION.md](IOS_MIGRATION.md)
for the current matrix, artifacts, app tests, and pending physical-device checks.
