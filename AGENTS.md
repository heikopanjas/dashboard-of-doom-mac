# Agent Instructions for Dashboard of Doom (macOS and iOS)

*Last updated: September 7, 2026, 14:00 CEST (macOS combined Sensors tab)*

## Project Overview

Dashboard of Doom is a sophisticated macOS menu bar application providing real-time environmental and public health data visualization for Germany. The application integrates with multiple German federal APIs to create an interactive, location-aware environmental monitoring system.

**Platforms**: This repository builds macOS 15+ and iOS 26+ apps. The original iOS develop history is imported under `ios/`. Root `project.yml` is the only Xcode project source of truth; see `ios/MIGRATION.md`.

### Current Implementation Status
- **Fully Functional**: Complete data pipeline from API integration to UI presentation
- **macOS Menu Bar App**: Lightweight menu bar extra with settings window
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, retry mechanisms, and quality assessment
- **Modern Swift**: Uses async/await; app uses Swift 5 language mode, local packages use Swift 6 with Swift tools 6.2
- **State Management**: Full `@Observable` implementation for reactive UI updates
- **Mathematical Analysis**: Advanced forecasting and trend analysis capabilities

## Architecture & Code Patterns

### Repository Structure
- **App Roots**: `macos/DashboardOfDoom/` owns macOS entry point, menu, settings, and detail views; `ios/DashboardOfDoom/` owns iOS entry point, navigation, settings, detail views, and assets
- **Test Layout**: `macos/Tests` and `ios/Tests` hold platform tests; `ios/UITests` holds UI tests; `shared/Tests` is compiled by both app test targets. Each platform owns `BuildTests`; packages and their tests live under `shared/doom-kit-*`.
- **Shared App Code**: `shared/Sources/` owns controllers, models, presenters, transformers, extensions, and map/POI views
- **Platform-Specific**: Views and some Presenters contain macOS-specific implementations
- **XcodeGen**: `project.yml` defines both app targets, tests, settings, dependencies, and schemes; `DashboardOfDoom.xcodeproj` is generated

### Platform Architecture
- **macOS**: MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern optimized for menu bar applications
- **Menu Bar Interface**: Lightweight status bar extra with popover/window presentation
- **Settings Window**: Dedicated configuration interface for user preferences
- **Shared Business Logic**: Both apps compile `shared/Sources/` and use the same five local DoomKit packages

### Core Components

#### Data Flow Architecture
```
Controllers → Services → Transformers → Presenters → Views
```

1. **Controllers**: Orchestrate API communication and data parsing
2. **Services**: Handle HTTP requests to German federal APIs
3. **Transformers**: Process raw data into UI-ready formats with quality assessment
4. **Presenters**: Manage application state using `@Observable` macro
5. **Views**: SwiftUI interfaces with environment-based dependency injection

#### Key Design Patterns
- **Subscription System**: package-owned `ProcessCoordinator`, constructed by `AppProcess.shared`, supplies location/readiness to `DoomKitProcess.ProcessManager<Context>`
- **Observation**: typed per-consumer AsyncStream state for location/connectivity; `ProcessRefreshable` is a public package presenter contract
- **Transformer Pattern**: Clean separation of data processing from presentation logic
- **Quality Assessment**: Built-in measurement validation with `.good`, `.uncertain`, `.bad`, `.unknown` states
- **Mathematical Analysis**: Moving averages, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA forecasting
- **Unit Safety**: Custom `Dimension` subclasses with `@unchecked Sendable` conformance
- **Concurrent Processing**: All API calls and data transformations use structured concurrency

## Technology Stack

### Swift & SwiftUI
- **Swift Language Mode**: Swift 5 (`SWIFT_VERSION = 5.0`), with async/await and structured concurrency
- **SwiftUI**: Native UI framework for the macOS 15.0+ app target
- **WeatherKit**: Apple's native weather data framework for real-time conditions
- **@Observable**: Primary state management macro for reactive UI updates
- **async/await**: Modern concurrency patterns throughout all controllers and services
- **Sendable**: Proper concurrency safety with `@unchecked Sendable` for custom unit types

### Data Sources & APIs
- **WeatherKit**: Apple's weather service for real-time weather data
- **BfS (Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz)**: Radiation monitoring
- **UBA (Umweltbundesamt)**: Air quality data (PM10, PM2.5, O3, NO2)
- **Pegelonline**: Federal waterway and shipping administration
- **NINA API**: National warning system for civil protection
- **Corona-Zahlen.org**: COVID-19 statistics
- **OpenStreetMap**: Geographic data and points of interest via Overpass API
- **DAWUM**: Political polling and survey data with categorical gradient visualization

## Code Style Guidelines

### Swift Conventions
- Use modern Swift syntax compatible with Swift 5 language mode, including structured concurrency
- Prefer `async/await` over completion handlers throughout the application
- Use `@Observable` for state management in all presenters
- Implement `@unchecked Sendable` for custom `Dimension` unit types
- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines with clear, descriptive naming
- Use meaningful, descriptive variable and function names
- Ensure thread safety with proper `Sendable` conformance where needed

### SwiftUI Best Practices
- Environment-based dependency injection for presenters
- Prefer `@State` and `@Environment` for data flow
- Use macOS APIs; retain platform conditionals where needed in shared code
- Implement proper view hierarchies and modifiers

### Architecture Patterns
- Controllers should handle data orchestration only
- Services should be stateless and handle pure HTTP communication
- Transformers should process data without side effects
- Presenters should manage state and provide data to views
- Views should be passive and reactive to state changes

## Data Processing

### Quality Assessment System
- **Four-Tier Quality**: `.good`, `.uncertain`, `.bad`, `.unknown` quality states
- **Temporal Validation**: Data consistency checks across time series
- **Confidence Scoring**: Automatic quality assessment based on data freshness and source reliability
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle missing or invalid data with appropriate fallbacks
- **Custom Data Fields**: Support for additional metadata in `ProcessValue` structures

### Mathematical Analysis Capabilities
- **Moving Averages**: Simple and exponential moving averages for trend smoothing
- **ARIMA Forecasting**: Autoregressive integrated moving average predictions
- **Interpolation**: Gap filling for missing data points in time series
- **Nowcasting**: Real-time current value estimation from recent trends
- **Statistical Processing**: Advanced statistical analysis for data validation

### Measurement Units
- Use Foundation's `Measurement` and `Unit` types
- Support automatic unit conversion and standardization
- Display units with proper formatting and localization

### Mathematical Symbols
- Use Unicode mathematical symbols for data presentation:
  - Ω (Omega) for COVID-19 data
  - Γ (Gamma) for radiation data
  - ρμ (Rho Mu) for particle data
  - τ (Tau) for temperature
  - η (Eta) for water levels
  - ν (Nu) for survey data

### Data Visualization Patterns
- **Gradient Color Coding**: Sophisticated gradient systems for categorical data representation
- **Political Data Visualization**: Custom gradient mappings for survey data with semantic color associations
- **Environmental Gradients**: Color-coded severity scales for air quality, radiation, and water levels
- **Temporal Visualization**: Trend indicators with mathematical forecasting display

## Network & Error Handling

### HTTP Communication Architecture
- **URLSession Extensions**: Custom `dataWithRetry` methods for resilient networking
- **Structured Concurrency**: All network calls use async/await patterns
- **Automatic Retries**: Exponential backoff retry mechanisms built into URLSession extension
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for different data source types
- **Connection Monitoring**: Network availability detection via NetworkManager actor
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All external API communications use secure protocols

### Error Management
- Comprehensive error handling throughout the data pipeline
- Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- User-friendly error messages and recovery options
- Trace utility for structured logging and debugging

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### macOS Menu Bar Application
- Status item shows current temperature; clicking it opens a menu (Open Dashboard, Settings, About, Quit), not the dashboard itself
- Dashboard is a real `Window` scene (`AppDelegate.dashboardWindowID`), opened/focused/closed via `AppDelegate.showDashboard()`/`hideDashboard()`/`toggleDashboard()`
- User-configurable system-wide hotkey (default Cmd+Ctrl+D) toggles the dashboard window, built on the `KeyboardShortcuts` package; recorder lives in Settings > General
- Settings window for configuration; "About..." opens it on the About tab via `AppDelegate.showSettings(tab:)` and `SettingsSelection`
- Dark mode optimization
- Native macOS appearance integration
- App is `LSUIElement`; menu item key equivalents (Settings ⌘,, Quit ⌘Q) only fire while the status menu is open, the global hotkey is the only system-wide binding
- Dashboard window is freely resizable (minimum 700x500, no maximum) via `ContentView`'s `.frame(minWidth:minHeight:)` and `.windowResizability(.contentMinSize)`
- Content is tab-based (`DashboardTab`), not scrolling disclosure panels: a toolbar strip (`ToolbarTabButton`, shared with `SettingsView`) switches between Home (full-size map), Weather, COVID-19, Sensors, and Polls
- The Sensors tab (`SensorsView`) stacks Level, Radiation, and Particles in one scrolling view, each keeping its own placemark/last-update header since these sensors can each sit at a different location; `SettingsTab` keeps them as three separate tabs with independent toggles and refresh intervals — the two are unrelated
- Charts are bare, fixed 167-point cells in a two-column `LazyVGrid` with no card or container chrome; do not add fills, borders, or rounded corners, and do not make chart height depend on window size
- The Home map gets the same outer `.padding()` as the category tabs and nothing else

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Testing
- Test core business logic in controllers and transformers
- Mock external API dependencies
- Validate data processing and quality assessment logic
- Test measurement calculations and unit conversions

### Integration Testing
- Validate API communication and response parsing
- Test data pipeline from service to presenter
- Verify error handling and retry mechanisms

### UI Testing
- Test SwiftUI interface behavior and user interactions
- Validate macOS menu bar and settings window behavior
- Test accessibility and localization features

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- Process GPS data locally, never transmit location
- Implement secure HTTPS communication
- Minimal local data caching with automatic cleanup
- Respect user privacy settings and data source toggles

### API Security
- Use secure endpoints for government data sources
- Implement proper authentication where required
- Handle API rate limiting and usage quotas

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Management
- Efficient data processing and transformation
- Proper cleanup of network resources
- Memory-conscious caching strategies

### Data Updates & Subscription System
- **ProcessCoordinator**: package-owned stream observation, app-injected Berlin fallback, first-measurement refresh, and bounded startup readiness
- **DoomKitProcess.ProcessManager**: main-actor UUID registrations, cancellable 60-second scheduling, and cancel/restart refresh generations
- **ProcessRefreshable Protocol**: Standardized interface for reactive data consumers
- **ProcessManager registrations**: UUID subscription management with configurable intervals
- **Intelligent Refresh**: Different intervals based on data type and update frequency:
  - Weather: Real-time updates with 5-minute fallback
  - Air Quality: 30-minute intervals with immediate alerts
  - Water Levels: 15-minute intervals for hydrological data
  - COVID-19: 6-hour intervals for epidemiological data
  - Radiation: Continuous real-time monitoring
  - Civil Protection: Immediate push notifications for alerts
  - Political Surveys: Daily updates with trend analysis

### Implemented Utilities
- **ARIMA**: Autoregressive integrated moving average forecasting
- **MovingAverage**: Simple and exponential moving average calculations
- **HaversineDistance**: Geographic distance calculations
- **PointInPolygon**: Spatial geometry operations
- **PolygonProximityCalculator**: Distance to polygon calculations
- **OSMUtilities**: OpenStreetMap data processing helpers
- **MathematicalSymbols**: Unicode symbols for data visualization
- **Trace**: Structured logging utility for debugging and monitoring

## Development Workflow

### XcodeGen Project Management

- Treat `project.yml` as the source of truth; edit it instead of generated project files
- Require XcodeGen 2.46.0+; install with `brew install xcodegen`
- Run `xcodegen generate` after cloning and before builds, including after spec changes
- Use `./macos/build.sh` for a signed Debug build and `./macos/build.sh --release` for Release; the script regenerates the project and fixes output paths under `.build/`
- For archives, override Xcode build-location preferences instead of passing `SYMROOT` or `OBJROOT`; Xcode must derive its own archive subdirectories or finalization fails with a missing `BuildProductsPath`.
- `./macos/build.sh --clean` only removes root `.build/`, `Build/`, and legacy `build/` outputs, including archives and exports; combine with `--release` or `--notarize` to clean before building
- `./macos/build.sh --notarize` archives Release, exports with `macos/exportOptions.plist`, submits to Apple, staples an accepted result, validates, and creates a distribution ZIP
- Notarization uses the `DashboardOfDoom-Notarize` Keychain profile, overridable with `NOTARIZE_PROFILE`
- For unsigned compilation checks, use the manual `xcodebuild` command in README.md with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
- Validate script changes with `bash -n macos/build.sh`, `shellcheck macos/build.sh`, and `python3 -m unittest discover -s macos/BuildTests -v` and `python3 -m unittest discover -s ios/BuildTests -v`; the Python tests mock builds and notarization
- Keep the existing signing configuration, app identity, and WeatherKit entitlement unless explicitly changing them; configure signing in the spec, including SDK-specific overrides
- Generated project files are ignored, except the tracked package lockfile at `DashboardOfDoom.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/Package.resolved`
- Preserve locked dependency revisions during unrelated changes
- Local package tests: run `swift test --package-path shared/doom-kit-location`, then `doom-kit-network`, then `doom-kit-process`, `doom-kit-tools`, and `doom-kit-services`; repeat Process, Tools, and Services with `-c release`; tests use injected dependencies and no live network
- `PointOfInterestTests` is an unhosted macOS Swift Testing target. Run `xcodegen generate`, then `xcodebuild -project DashboardOfDoom.xcodeproj -scheme PointOfInterestTests -destination 'platform=macOS' -derivedDataPath .build/poi-tests test`. Its filtered synchronized source folder excludes the app entry point; tests inject fetching, location, time, and preferences.
- POIs use a single Canvas with one Core Graphics image pass beneath environmental labels, never the collision solver. Repeated SwiftUI symbol/image draws crashed the GPU encoder in the 10,000-point stress fixture; preserve the batched Core Graphics path. Preserve stable OSM identities, category toggles, all-point rendering, Apple POIs, and region fitting. Project only after geometry/camera changes, using the deferred MapReader registration safeguard.
- The app delegate owns the POI presenter lifecycle. Keep the 6,666.67-metre radius, one-hour cache within 1 km, minute expiry checks, five-minute failure cooldown, and two-request concurrency limit across cancelled generations. Never start or stop shared location tracking from the POI presenter.

- COVID, water levels, radiation, particles, and polls own preference-observed conditional subscriptions; disabled sources retain values but cancel and remove refresh work. Weather and forecasts always refresh regardless of display visibility.

### iOS Lifecycle and Validation

- Use `feature/ios-modernization` for this migration. Preserve the imported iOS history; do not restore its obsolete standalone Xcode project or duplicate services.
- iOS 6.3.0 (178) uses the user-confirmed bundle `com.panjas.dashboard-of-doom`, automatic signing team `8J2G689FCZ`, WeatherKit entitlement, and background location plist mode. macOS is 6.4.3 (147) with unchanged identity/signing.
- `IOSAppDelegate` owns one runtime and all presenters. Its lifecycle starts once and refreshes once after background return, without stopping background location. Do not instantiate dormant hazards or start location from a presenter/view.
- `LocationConfiguration.continuousBackground` is iOS-only: best accuracy, Always request, background updates enabled, automatic pauses disabled, background indicator enabled. Default macOS behavior remains kilometer accuracy and When In Use.
- Preserve the strictly-greater-than-100-metre movement filter. The iOS coordinator uses everyMovement; default macOS uses firstMeasurement. Keep immediate fallback startup and cancellation checks.
- iOS keeps showWater, enableElectionPolls default false, and showElectionPolls default true. Only enableElectionPolls controls poll fetching. Other conditional sources use their switches; weather and forecasts always fetch. Preserve successful values while disabled.
- Use `./ios/build.sh` for unsigned simulator Debug, `--release` for Release, `--device` for signed device compilation, and `--simulator UUID --run` to launch at HKW. The script never cleans or uploads.
- All simulator testing uses HKW, 52.51889, 13.36528. Start simulated movement there. Disable parallel test clones when testing location using `-parallel-testing-enabled NO`.
- `iOSTests` is an unhosted Swift Testing target; `iOSUITests` uses XCTest for navigation, gestures, orientations, appearances, Dynamic Type, and 2,000/10,000-POI screenshots. Debug-only `--ui-fixture` data never starts network/location work. Release omits this fixture.
- Package simulator tests run from each package directory using its package-name scheme. Release tests need `ENABLE_TESTABILITY=YES` for @testable imports; keep optimization enabled. Isolate derived data, SYMROOT, and OBJROOT for concurrent builds.
- Simulator tests do not establish real background delivery or WeatherKit authorization. Record physical-device results separately in ios/MIGRATION.md.

### Map Annotation Layout

- `MapView` creates one snapshot ordered weather, COVID, particles, water, radiation, surveys; category IDs survive measurement refreshes.
- `CollisionMapView` keeps native dots at geographic coordinates and projects with `MapReader` from camera callbacks and a geometry-keyed cancellable view task, never during body rendering.
- Labels and category-colored connectors use `MapAnnotationOverlay`; connector drawing clips around every native dot and is hidden from accessibility.
- Environmental label backgrounds use full opacity while the POI master switch is enabled, including loading or empty results; otherwise they use 0.5 opacity.
- `MapAnnotationLabel` shares its 131 × 33-point outer dimensions with `DoomKitTools.AnnotationLayout`; preserve colors, icons, text, and padding.
- After geometry changes, defer projection until MapReader registers its map; retry at most eight 16 ms passes, publish once, and cancel on replacement/disappearance.
- Cache by projected geometry, visibility, and size; text-only updates reuse placements. Publish geometry and placement together without animation.
- The pure Tools solver uses an 8-point inset, 6-point label separation, 4-point clearance for unrelated markers (attached labels meet their source dot), and a deterministic beam capped at 256 retained arrangements.
- Try previous relative placements and eight anchors, then 40–160-point outward offsets and a bounded viewport grid. After collision/clipping, minimize connector count and prefer direct above-right attachment; retain previous placement only as a final tie-breaker.
- Score clipping from nonnegative outside strips, never by subtracting nearly equal areas; ignore edge noise at or below 0.0000001 point before scoring, and keep the comparator strictly ordered.
- Preserve all labels in undersized viewports using the best bounded-search result; skip unprojectable coordinates until valid. Never change region fitting to accommodate labels.
- Keep the Weather dot when its label is disabled, preserve selectors and settings behavior, and retain platform label dimensions: macOS 131 × 33 points, iOS 132 × 36 points. iOS caps visual map-label Dynamic Type to fit fixed bounds; full values remain accessible.

### Local Package Boundaries

- `doom-kit-location` / `DoomKitLocation`: location values, provider-independent state streams and movement filtering, separate async geocoding
- `doom-kit-network` / `DoomKitNetwork`: network actor, typed state streams, injectable monitoring/transport/timing, shared request execution
- `doom-kit-process` / `DoomKitProcess`: process models, custom units, geographic helpers, open observable presenter and transformer bases, coordinator, generic main-actor scheduler and injected clock; local dependencies on DoomKitLocation and DoomKitNetwork
- `doom-kit-tools` / `DoomKitTools`: generic Measurement smoothing, ARIMA, polygon/bounding-box helpers, symbols, and mutex-protected synchronous Sendable Trace; depends only on DoomKitLocation
- `doom-kit-services` / `DoomKitServices`: seven public static API services with trailing injectable NetworkManager defaults; depends on Location, Network, and Tools
- Keep smoothing independent of ProcessValue; app callers rebuild values in order with original metadata, timestamps, quality, units, and new UUIDs
- Preserve original unit coefficients and base units, numeric algorithms, service URL/date behavior, and failure-to-nil cancellation contract during extraction work
- All packages use Swift tools 6.2 and Swift 6 language mode; keep the app in Swift 5 mode
- Packages declare macOS 15 and iOS 26; both app targets integrate them. See ios/MIGRATION.md for simulator and device validation limits.
- Each state consumer owns a separate latest-value stream and explicitly cancelled task; stop finishes all streams and restart requires new subscriptions
- Location initialization does not request permission or track; the private Core Location provider starts explicitly with kilometer accuracy
- Native `CLLocationUpdate.liveUpdates()` is a planned provider replacement; validate accuracy, authorization, delivery, cancellation, and background behavior separately
- Refresh closures must check cancellation after awaits and immediately before synchronous publication; use per-refresh transformer state
- Keep concrete presenters, Berlin fallback configuration, settings, and the starting `AppProcess.shared` factory in the app; shared process models and coordinator lifecycle policy belong to DoomKitProcess
- Preserve the unrelated theme notification observer

- Overpass requests share one cancellation-aware transport queue in DoomKitNetwork. Keep COVID and waterway discovery ahead of background POIs; never rotate endpoints on HTTP 429. Availability fallback uses overpass.private.coffee, and missing waterway discovery falls back to the nearest official gauge.
